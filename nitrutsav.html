			<h4><a href="#">Mendeleevean Show</a> </h4>
            Quest and hunger for knowledge is inevitable. In this rat racing world where we thrive for knowledge and power, one cannot
             find a better platform to display one’s intellect than a quiz. Usually quizzes are all about science and technology. 
             Breaking all the stereotypes, AIChE NITR Student Chapter has come up with a fun event this NitrUtsav (NU),
              named “Mendeleevean Show”.<br>

            The game incorporates a dart game followed by a quiz based on all fields like cinema, novels, TV series.This is a team game
             with two participants in each team. Come and be a part of this unique game.<br>
             The Great Mendeleevian Show organized by us during NU 2k19 witnessed a footfall of 105 enthusiastic participants. The
              game has not only broken all the stereotypes but has also setup a benchmark for other events in terms of fun and
               participation. We thank Archie's Gift Store for being our Co sponsor in NU 2k19.
